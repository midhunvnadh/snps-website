<p style = "font-size:21px;padding:15px;">Sree Narayana Guru, one of the greatest proponents and re-evaluators of Advaita Vedanta, the principle of non-duality put forward by Adi Shankara, for both hail from the same pristine land of Kerala. He was also an egalitarian who advocated social equality and universal brotherhood. The Guru worked hard as a social educationist and condemned discrimination in the name of caste, creed and religion. Education was one of his primary concerns by which, he believed, that one could uplift his/her quality of life. His philosophies are best reflected in his poetic ventures that mingles aesthetically the principles of ethics, logics and metaphysics. His famous words one caste, one religion and one god for man worked as a fresh waft in the socio-cultural realm of the then Kerala.</p>
